    <h1>Hi there, I'm Evan!</h1>
    <p>&emsp;I am a current University of Michigan student pursuing a Bachelor's of Business Administration with a minor in Computer Science. Before coming to the University of Michigan, I attended Muscatine High School where I was the president of the Peer Tutoring Program and active in our student government. I also participated in Mock Trial, the School Improvment Advisory Committee, the National Honor Society and played goalie for the JV Soccer Team.</p>
