                        the most useful of which has been

                        &emsp;One of my main projects is recreating classical games in the
                        terminal via C++. These games include <a href="#">Monoploy</a>,
                        <a href="#">Tic-Tac-Toe</a>, <a href="#">Battleship</a> and
                        <a href="#">Connect 4</a>. Eventually I plan on using GLUT to make the
                        games visually appealing on top of functional. In addition to the
                        grapihcs, I also am attempting to implement an AI for all of these
                        games, which is harder for some games than others. All of these games I
                        create over time and often jump from one to another so I consider them
                        all WiPs.

                        relativley easy. This class was geared towards people with no previous
                        programing expereince. Some noteble projects were OhHi and Coonnect 4
                        (which is the connect 4 I continue to work on). For Honor code reasons
                        the code cannot be shared.

                        challanaging as they dealt with more challanging topics (image
                        manipulation, machine learning, linked lists, complex classes, etc.).
