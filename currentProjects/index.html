        <p>&emsp;One of my main projects is recreating classical games in the terminal via C++. This games include Monoploy, Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect 4.

In addition to the grapihcs, I also am attempting to implement AI for all of these games. <a href="">Read more about these projets here...</a></p>
